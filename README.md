## üöÄ Introduction

A sleek and user-friendly profile interface for SmoothPark‚Äîa platform offering decentralized parking solutions. This page enables users to manage account details, vehicles, payment methods, and track usage history.

With increasing urbanization, parking space management has become a growing concern in smart cities. This project addresses the pressing need for a scalable, intelligent, and user-friendly smart parking system, aligning with modern urban planning goals and sustainability initiatives.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Parking congestion is a major urban challenge that leads to increased traffic, fuel consumption, and frustration. The traditional method of searching for parking manually is inefficient and time-consuming.

**Key Challenges:**
- Lack of real-time parking space visibility
- Wastage of fuel and time due to manual search
- Inefficient monetization of private parking spaces
- No centralized platform for smart parking solutions

## ‚ú® Features

### For Users
- **Real-time parking search and booking**
- **AI-based parking recommendations**
- **Booking history and favorites**
- **Dark/light theme support**
- **Profile management**

### For Parking Space Owners
- **List available parking spaces**
- **View and manage bookings**
- **Track income and space usage**

### For Administrators
- **View all registered users**
- **Manage listings and moderate reported content**
- **Analytics and report generation** (future scope)

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

ParkIn uses a layered architecture comprising:

- **Presentation Layer:** React Native UI components
- **Application Layer:** Business logic, API handling
- **Data Layer:** Firebase for authentication, MongoDB for storage
- **AI Layer:** Recommender system (Python Flask API)

## üíª Implementation

- Developed using **React Native** and **TailwindCSS** for modern UI
- **Firebase authentication** used for user management
- Mock data simulates booking, history, and favorites
- Modular code with future-proof architecture for IoT and AI integration

## üì± Requirements

### Functional Requirements
